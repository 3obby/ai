# AgentConsult App Restructuring Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation Restructuring
- ✅ Create the new directory structure
  - ✅ Created app/features/{companions,chat-engine,group-chat,chat-config}/{components,hooks,utils}
  - ✅ Created app/shared/{components,hooks,utils,types}
  - ✅ Created app/api/{auth,companions,chats/{group,individual,config},files,payments}
- ✅ Migrate shared components and utilities
  - ✅ Migrated UI components to app/shared/components/ui
  - ✅ Migrated shared types to app/shared/types
  - ✅ Migrated shared utilities to app/shared/utils
  - ✅ Migrated shared hooks to app/shared/hooks
- ✅ Implement the simplified data models
  - ✅ Created app/shared/types/chat.ts with unified Chat model, configuration as extension, and standardized participant model

## Phase 2: Core Feature Migration (Completed)

### Component Migration
- [x] Migrate Companions feature components
- [x] Migrate Chat Engine components
- [x] Migrate Group Chat components 
- [x] Migrate Chat Configuration components

### State Management
- [x] Implement new state management approach for Companions
- [x] Implement new state management approach for Chat Engine
- [x] Implement new state management approach for Group Chat

### Improved Workflows
- [x] Implement improved workflow for chat creation
- [x] Implement improved workflow for group chat management
- [x] Implement improved workflow for companion configuration

### Notes
- The migration of components should be coordinated to maintain feature parity.
- Create utilities for migrating data from old structure to new one, if necessary.
- Create comprehensive tests for the migrated features to ensure functionality.

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Completed)

### Server Components Migration
- [x] Convert suitable components to Server Components
- [x] Implement efficient data fetching patterns with Server Components
- [x] Optimize metadata and SEO with Server Components

### Cache Management
- [x] Implement React Cache for expensive operations
- [x] Configure persistent SWR cache between sessions
- [x] Add revalidation strategies for stale data

### Loading Optimization
- [x] Implement streaming for long operations
- [x] Add suspense boundaries for loading states
- [x] Implement lazy loading for less critical components

### Notes
- Server Components conversion should prioritize components that don't require client-side state
- Consider implementing Suspense for data fetching patterns
- Document caching strategies for easier maintenance

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: UX Enhancement (Completed)

### Wizard Flows for Complex Operations
- [x] Create step-by-step companion creation wizard
- [x] Implement group chat creation wizard
- [x] Add template customization wizard

### Real-time Previews
- [x] Implement real-time preview for templates
- [x] Add desktop/mobile view toggling for previews
- [x] Create preview functionality for companion configuration

### Template System Enhancement
- [x] Implement categorization and filtering for templates
- [x] Add template sharing and embedding capabilities
- [x] Create template rating and favoriting system

### Notes
- Wizard flows significantly improve user experience for complex operations
- Real-time previews provide immediate feedback during configuration
- Enhanced template system allows for better discovery and sharing of templates

### Phase 5: Analytics and Insights
- [ ] Implement detailed usage analytics
- [ ] Create companion performance metrics
- [ ] Add user engagement tracking

## Completed Items Details

### Directory Structure
The project now follows a domain-driven design structure with clear separation of concerns:

- `app/features/`: Contains feature-specific components, hooks, and utilities
- `app/shared/`: Contains shared code used across features
- `app/api/`: Contains API routes organized by domain

### Migrated Components
UI components have been migrated to the shared directory to be reused across features.

### Simplified Data Models
Implemented a unified Chat data model with:
- Type discriminator to distinguish between individual and group chats
- Configuration as an extension to the chat model
- Standardized participant model for both AI companions and human users
- Factory functions for creating individual and group chats

### State Management
Implemented a modern state management approach:
- React Context for component state sharing
- SWR for data fetching with caching and revalidation
- Optimized data flow with proper provider patterns
- Separation of UI state from data fetching

### Server Components
Implemented Server Components for better performance:
- Created server-compatible versions of component pages
- Implemented server-side data fetching with React Cache
- Used metadata API for better SEO

### Cache Management
Implemented comprehensive caching strategy:
- React Cache for server-side data fetching to reduce database calls
- Persistent SWR cache for client-side data to maintain state between sessions
- Custom revalidation strategies based on time-to-live and dependency relationships

### Loading Optimization
Implemented efficient loading techniques:
- Streaming responses for chat messages and long-running operations
- Suspense boundaries for parallel data loading and better UX during loading
- Lazy loading for less critical components to improve initial page load times

### Wizard Flows
Implemented step-by-step guided workflows:
- Companion creation wizard with 4-step process (basic info, personality, knowledge, review)
- Group chat creation wizard with participant selection and configuration
- Template customization wizard with real-time preview

### Real-time Previews
Added immediate feedback during configuration:
- Template previews that update in real-time as settings change
- Mobile/desktop view toggle for responsive design testing
- Component-specific previews (chat, companion, group chat)

### Enhanced Template System
Improved template discovery and management:
- Categorization, tagging, and filtering system
- Sharing capabilities with embeddable templates
- Rating and favoriting system for personalization

## Notes for Future Work
- Need to coordinate migration with the team to avoid disrupting ongoing development
- Consider creating a utility to help migrate existing data to the new model
- Develop comprehensive tests to ensure the restructured app functions as expected
