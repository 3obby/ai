# Implementation Plan for Performance Optimizations

Based on the server logs analysis, we identified several critical performance issues affecting anonymous user experience. The initial load time of 30+ seconds is unacceptable and must be optimized. This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan.

## Performance Issues Summary

1. **Slow Database Queries (5000ms+)**
   - Inefficient materialized view existence checks (3020ms)
   - Slow companion count queries (5462ms)
   - Redundant queries for same data

2. **Large Response Payloads (5.4MB)**
   - Excessive data being sent to anonymous users
   - Too many companions with full data

3. **Inefficient Redis Caching**
   - Large objects requiring chunking
   - Inefficient cache key management

4. **Multiple Database Round-trips**
   - Separate queries for related data
   - No effective query batching

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Apply Database Optimizations

Use the `db-performance-fixes.ts` script to:

1. Create optimized materialized view with fewer columns
2. Add efficient partial indexes for anonymous user queries
3. Analyze tables to improve query planner statistics
4. Set up automatic refresh procedure for materialized views

```bash
# Run the optimization script
npx ts-node optimizations/db-performance-fixes.ts
```

### Step 2: Replace Dashboard Prefetch Implementation

1. Replace the existing implementation in `app/api/dashboard/prefetch/route.ts` with our optimized version:
   - Skip the slow materialized view check (3000ms savings)
   - Use optimized Prisma queries with proper limiting
   - Return minimal data for anonymous users (80% payload reduction)
   - Implement more aggressive caching for anonymous users

2. Key changes:
   - Direct Prisma queries with minimal fields
   - Shorter description length
   - Timeout handling with fallback estimates
   - Longer cache TTL for anonymous users

### Step 3: Implement Static Cache for Anonymous Dashboard

1. Deploy the static cache solution:
   - Precompute dashboard data for anonymous users
   - Store in a static JSON file that doesn't require DB access
   - Set up automatic refresh via cron job

2. Update the dashboard route to use static cache for initial load:
   - First request serves static data with no DB queries
   - Background refresh for up-to-date data

### Step 4: Optimize Redis Caching

1. Implement the optimized Redis caching module:
   - Smaller chunk size (250KB vs 500KB)
   - Versioned cache keys for easy invalidation
   - Pipeline operations for better performance
   - Improved error handling with graceful fallbacks

2. Cache strategy changes:
   - Increase TTL for anonymous users (10 minutes vs 2 minutes)
   - Use static cache as backup when Redis fails

### Step 5: Configure CDN and Edge Caching

1. Enable Vercel Edge Caching:
   - Add appropriate cache headers to API responses
   - Configure anonymous route caching at the edge

2. Update middleware to route anonymous users efficiently:
   - Serve cached responses without hitting origin servers
   - Add anonymous identification via cookies

### Additional Optimizations

1. **Database Maintenance Tasks**
   - Set up daily VACUUM ANALYZE to optimize table statistics
   - Schedule materialized view refresh during low-traffic periods

2. **Response Compression**
   - Implement Gzip/Brotli compression for all API responses
   - Reduce payload sizes by 70-80%

3. **Monitoring Implementation**
   - Add detailed performance logging for key queries
   - Track cache hit/miss rates

## Expected Performance Improvements

With these optimizations, we should see:

- **Anonymous User Initial Load**: From 30+ seconds to under 500ms
- **Payload Size**: From 5.4MB to under 500KB
- **Database Query Time**: From 5000ms+ to under 200ms
- **Redis Memory Usage**: Significantly reduced chunking needs

## Monitoring and Validation

After implementation, we will validate improvements by:

1. Measuring before/after load times in the browser console
2. Analyzing server logs for query durations
3. Monitoring Redis memory usage patterns
4. Tracking Vercel edge hit rates

## Rollback Plan

If any issues arise:

1. Revert the dashboard prefetch route to the original implementation
2. Disable static caching
3. Return to the original Redis implementation
4. Run database maintenance to revert index changes if needed

## Long-term Recommendations

1. Implement proper database sharding for larger datasets
2. Consider moving to a more specialized caching solution for large responses
3. Implement progressive loading for the companion list
4. Add database query monitoring with slow query alerts
